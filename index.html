            <hr>
            <p>The visualisation below the population by each state in 2020. We can see that California is the most populus state in USA.
                Where texas is coming in second, Florida in the third. By pure glimpse observation, without looking at the positive tests data
                we can already see that these 3 states will be heavily raided by COVID-19.

            <h3> COVID-19 Positive tests for each months </h3>
            <hr>
            <p> From the visualisation below, we can see how COVID-19 has spread accross US according to positive tests that are conducted.
                We can see that the worst spread happens in November, and we can also see that the most populus city has the most positive tests.
                It is safe to assume that California, Texas, and Florida will have the most positive tests given their population count.
                And indeed this assumption is true. If we go to November which is the eleventh month in the Gregorian Calendar, we can see that
                the most darker reds reside in california, Texas, and Florida.

            <hr>
            <p> This chart below shows the proportion of Positive tests against Negative tests. It is very clear that most of the positive tests that are occuring in every state,
                has a smaller proportion compared to Negative tests. We can also see that for states that are high in positive tests, they are also high in negative tests which result
                in total counts in tests.

            <hr>
            <p> Below it shows the 4 major cities where positive tests are highest, this chart how positive tests has grown overtime. From the visualisation below we can also see that
                firstly New York rapidly increasing first then the other 3 major cities increases and caught up with New York. In the end, California is the highest. In conclusion, the movement
                of COVID-19 moves rapidly in large population cities.
