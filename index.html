            <hr>
            <p>The visualisation below the population by each state in 2020. We can see that California is the most populus state in USA.
                Where texas is coming in second, Florida in the third. By pure glimpse observation, without looking at the positive tests data
                we can already see that these 3 states will be heavily raided by COVID-19.

            <h3> COVID-19 Positive tests for each months </h3>
            <hr>
            <p> From the visualisation below, we can see how COVID-19 has spread accross US according to positive tests that are conducted.
                We can see that the worst spread happens in November, and we can also see that the most populus city has the most positive tests.
                It is safe to assume that California, Texas, and Florida will have the most positive tests given their population count.
                And indeed this assumption is true. If we go to November which is the eleventh month in the Gregorian Calendar, we can see that
                the most darker reds reside in california, Texas, and Florida.
